 KarLS / Karl's absolutely reduced Linux System
 1.0 - Ardi

 KarLS started as an LFS project with musl and busybox using Makefiles for reproducibilty.
 I learnt a lot from buildroot (a really great and waaaaay more professional - and complicated - project).

 KarLS can be built using simple Makefiles - the almighty make command.

 Currently KarLS supports only the x86_64 architecture (some arm may be on the way, I've got a few Raspberry Pis).
 KarLS can be built into an ISO (it supports CD and USB, BIOS or - unsecured - EFI).
 I tested it mostly on VMware and some QEMU.

 The building process:

 - First build a (cross-)compiler for X86_64 with musl as libc. This is the default, later arm and other target architectures can come.
 - Then build a Kernel with modules and a really minimal initrd.
 - Then the OS packages.
 - Then the ISO for installing.

 make cmpl
 make kernel
 make pkg
 make iso
