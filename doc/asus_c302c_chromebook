KarLS ius able to run on Asus EOL C302C(A) chromebook.

TO test this, you have to delete the ChromeOS from it - the device is EOL, so it's basically a security nightmare or a paperweight anyway.

First, remove the write protection screw:

Then, unlock the UEFI (by reflashing it in developer mode):

To install KarLS, just write the ISO to a flashdrive and boot. I use Rufus.
